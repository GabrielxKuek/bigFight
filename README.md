# BIG FIGHT
## Story
In the world of **Big Fight**, there once co-existed two races: goblins and humans. They weren't particurally friendly to each other as there has been a few disputes between each other over the decades. And the intention reached its peak when the two nations built their bases very close to each other. Thus, the start of **Big Fight** begun. Whoever destroy the other's base first will be delcared the winner!!

Immerse yourself into a world of strategy and muscle cramps where the only thing between you and victory is your finger muscles. In this game, every click sends out one troop to the other tower, where they fight to eradicate the world of the enemy tower's existence. 

## Overview
We created this project during NUS Hack & Roll (2024). It was a 24 hours hackathon in which we had the avaliblity to choose any topics we want with several prises prices to win. The project is a Click Per Second (CPS) tester that allows two person to test it. Since normal CPS testers websites only allow a singal user to test at the same time, the latter tester always have the slight edge on the first one. Since the latter tester have a goal to aim. Therefore, to tackle this issue, we created **Big Fight**.

## How we did it
We used a lesser known library, called **Kaboom** to create the entirety of the project with bare minimum **HTML** to present in the website.

## Why we did it
Our original plan was to create a game like **Battle Cats** with a added twist on it. It was supposed to be palyable by other members instead of just palying against computer. However, due to our ambitious goal and limtied time and resources, we decided to save the idea for next time.
